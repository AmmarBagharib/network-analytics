# Network Analytics in R
A semester long module taught by Dr. Tan Tianhui in which I learn real world network analytics using R an Giphy.

Network analytics, also known as network analysis or graph analytics, is a field of study that involves analyzing and interpreting the relationships and interactions among entities within a network. A network can be represented as a graph, where entities are nodes and relationships are edges, and network analytics aims to extract valuable insights and patterns from this representation.

Network analytics encompasses a wide range of techniques and methods used to understand the structure, behavior, and dynamics of various types of networks, including social networks, biological networks, transportation networks, communication networks, and more. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns, discover communities or clusters, measure the importance of nodes, and gain insights into the overall system behavior.

Some key concepts and methods within network analytics include:

1. **Centrality Measures**: Metrics that identify important nodes within a network, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality.

2. **Community Detection**: Algorithms that partition a network into clusters of nodes that are more densely connected within the clusters than between them.

3. **Clustering Coefficients**: Measures of the extent to which nodes form tightly interconnected groups.

4. **Path Analysis**: Understanding paths and paths' properties between nodes, including shortest paths and connectivity patterns.

5. **Network Visualization**: Creating visual representations of networks to better understand their structure and relationships.

6. **Epidemic Spreading and Diffusion**: Studying how information, diseases, or other phenomena spread through a network.

7. **Link Prediction**: Predicting future edges based on existing network topology.

8. **Network Resilience**: Assessing a network's robustness to disruptions or attacks.

9. **Graph Algorithms**: Utilizing algorithms designed to operate on graphs, such as searching, traversal, and optimization algorithms.

10. **Temporal Networks**: Analyzing networks that change over time, capturing dynamic interactions.

Network analytics has applications in a wide range of fields, including social sciences, biology, computer science, economics, physics, and more. It helps researchers and analysts uncover hidden patterns, model complex interactions, make predictions, and gain deeper insights into the behavior and structure of interconnected systems.
